## How they Connect

::: {.center}
![](images/trinity-diagram.png){width=85% fig-alt="Diagram showing data flow between GTM, GA4, and GSC."}
:::

- Install <span class="text-cpp-green">GTM</span> on the site (not GA4 code directly)
- <span class="text-cpp-green">GTM</span> sends events to <span class="text-cpp-gold">GA4</span>
- Link <span class="text-teal">GSC</span> to <span class="text-cpp-gold">GA4</span> for organic query + landing-page reporting

::: {.notes}
- Trinity of Data Collection:
  a. GTM (Google Tag Manager): The Brain, Controls what data is sent and when.  
  b. GA4 (Google Analytics 4): The Database, Stores and reports the data.  
  c. GSC (Google Search Console): The Search Health Check: Monitors organic search visibility.
- Instructional design angle: students should be able to name the role of each tool in one sentence.

## Quick access links

- <span class="text-cpp-gold">GA4</span>: <https://analytics.google.com/>
- <span class="text-cpp-green">GTM</span>: <https://tagmanager.google.com/>
- <span class="text-teal">GSC</span>: <https://search.google.com/search-console/>



::: {.callout-tip}
Use one **Google account** across tools.

## Technical Implementation - GTM/GA4 (25 Min)

### **Goal**
Connect our **Quarto** site to the **Google Marketing Platform** (GA4 + GTM).

### **Assumptions**
To follow along, you need:

1.  **A Published Website:** Your site is live (e.g., Netlify, GitHub Pages).
2.  **Admin Access:** You have the ability to edit the source code or CMS settings.

::: {.callout-note}
## Why this matters
We are moving from "static pages" to "measurable data" by injecting tracking codes into your live environment.
:::

---

## The Account Setup

::: {.callout-tip}
## GA4: <https://analytics.google.com/> <br> GTM: <https://tagmanager.google.com/>
:::

Before we touch the code/website, we need the containers.

1.  **Create GTM Account:** Get your container ID (`GTM-XXXXXX`).
2.  **Install GTM Code:** Place the snippets on your website (`<head>` and `<body>`).
3.  **Create GA4 Property:** Get your Measurement ID (`G-XXXXXXXX`).
4.  **Connect in GTM:** Create a "Google Tag" inside GTM and paste your GA4 ID.
5.  **Publish:** Push the changes in GTM to make GA4 live.

## Create GTM Container

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
### The Setup
1.  **Log in:** [tagmanager.google.com](https://tagmanager.google.com).
2.  **Create Account:** Enter Company Name.
3.  **Create Container:** Enter Domain (e.g., `mysite.com`).
4.  **Select Platform:** Choose **Web**.
5.  **Install:** Get the `<head>` and `<body>` scripts.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Why GTM?
* **The Box Metaphor:** GTM is the empty box; GA4 is just one tool you put inside it.
* **Efficiency:** You install the GTM code **once**. Future changes (Facebook Pixel, LinkedIn Insight, GA4 Events) happen inside GTM, not your site code.


::::

## Create GA4 Property

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
#### The Setup
1. Go to **Analytics** > **Admin**.
2. Click **Create Account**.
3. Follow the wizard to create your **Property**.
4. **Save:** Copy the **Measurement ID** (`G-XXXXXXXX`) for your website code.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
#### Best Practices
* **One Property Rule:** Most businesses only need **1 Property**.
* **Cross-Device:** Combine your Website and App data in the *same* property for better user tracking.
* **When to split?** Only use multiple properties for different **Regions** (Timezones/Currencies) or **Marketing Teams**.
:::

## Connect GA4 to GTM

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
### The Connection
1.  **New Tag:** Select **Google Tag**.
2.  **ID:** Paste `G-XXXXXXXX`.
3.  **Trigger:** Choose **Initialization - All Pages**.
4.  **Save:** Name it "GA4 Config".
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### The Launch
1.  **Submit:** Click the blue button in the top right.
2.  **Version:** Give it a name (e.g., "Initial GA4 Launch").
3.  **Publish:** This pushes your changes to the live website.
:::

::::

> **Note:** Until you hit **Publish**, your changes are only saved in a "Draft" version.




---


## Validation

1.  **Open DebugView:**
    - Go to **GA4 Admin** > **Data Display** > **DebugView**.
2.  **Trigger Data:**
    - Open your website in a new tab (or use GTM Preview Mode).
    - Click around to generate events.
3.  **Verify:**
    - Look for the blue icons appearing on the timeline.
    - Confirm the `page_view` event is listed.

::: {.callout-important}
## Expected Outcome
If you see events populating the timeline in real-time, your connection is successful. If the timeline is empty, check if your ad blocker is on!
:::

## Search Visibility: Google Search Console (15 Min)

### **Goal**
1.  **Verify** ownership of your website with Google.
2.  **Connect** GSC data to your GA4 dashboard.

::: {.callout-note}
## Why do this?
* **GA4** tells you *what* users do on your site (clicks, scrolls).
* **GSC** tells you *how* users found you (keywords, rankings).
* **Together:** You see the full picture of your SEO performance.
:::

---

## Step 1: Add Property (Choose Type)

When you click "Add Property" in GSC, you have two choices:

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
### 1. Domain Property (Recommended)
* **Covers:** `example.com`, `m.example.com`, `www.example.com`, `http://`, `https://`.
* **Requires:** DNS Verification (Harder).
* **Best For:** Long-term business tracking.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### 2. URL Prefix
* **Covers:** ONLY the exact URL entered (e.g., `https://www.example.com`).
* **Requires:** File upload, HTML tag, or GA4 (Easier).
* **Best For:** Quick setup or if you lack DNS access.
:::

::::

---

## Step 2: Verify Ownership

Google needs proof you own the site. Choose the method that fits your access level:

| Method | Difficulty | Best Use Case |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **DNS Record** | High | **Domain Property.** Best for full coverage. Requires logging into GoDaddy/Namecheap. |
| **HTML File** | Medium | **URL Prefix.** You have FTP/File access to the server root. |
| **HTML Tag** | Low | **URL Prefix.** WordPress/Wix users. Copy/paste a meta tag into your header. |
| **GA4 / GTM** | **Lowest** | **URL Prefix.** If you *already* installed GA4/GTM (and have "Edit" permission), this verifies instantly! |

::: {.callout-tip}
## Pro Tip
If you just set up GA4/GTM in the previous step, try the **Google Analytics** verification method first. It's one click!
:::


---

## Step 3: Link GSC to GA4

Data doesn't appear automatically. You must **Link** and **Publish**.

1.  **Link:**
    * Go to **GA4 Admin** > **Product Links** > **Search Console Links**.
    * Click **Link**, select your GSC property, and confirm.
2.  **Publish Reports:**
    * Go to **Reports** > **Library** (bottom left folder icon).
    * Find the **"Search Console"** collection card.
    * Click the **3 dots** > **Publish**.

> **Result:** A new "Search Console" tab will appear in your main reporting menu, showing Queries and Landing Pages.

---

## Campaign Tracking: UTM Parameters (15 Min)

### **The Blind Spot**
Without UTMs, GA4 can usually tell you **where** a user came from (e.g., "They came from Facebook").

**But it cannot tell you:**
* **How** they got there (Paid Ad vs. Free Post?)
* **Why** they came (Spring Sale vs. Black Friday?)

::: {.callout-note}
## The Solution
UTM parameters are "tags" we add to the end of a link. They force GA4 to record exactly what we tell it to record.
:::

---

## Standardization Protocols

Data is only useful if it is consistent.

### **Rule 1: Case Sensitivity**
GA4 treats `Email`, `email`, and `EMAIL` as three completely different traffic sources.
* **Best Practice:** Always use **lowercase** for everything.

### **Rule 2: Fragmentation**
If five people on your team name campaigns differently, your reports will be unreadable.
* *Bad:* `spring-sale`, `Spring_Sale`, `springsale26`
* *Good:* `spring_sale_2026` (Standardized)

## Interactive Exercise

**Goal:** Create a tracking link for a **LinkedIn post** promoting the **Spring Workshop**.

1.  **Open Tool:** [Google Campaign URL Builder](https://ga-dev-tools.google/campaign-url-builder/)
2.  **Enter Values:**

| Parameter | Value | Logic |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Website URL** | `https://yoursite.com` | Where they go. |
| **Campaign Source** | `linkedin` | The specific site. |
| **Campaign Medium** | `social` | The marketing channel. |
| **Campaign Name** | `spring_workshop_2026` | The strategic effort. |

3.  **Result:** Copy the generated URL and test it.

---

## Standard UTM Parameters

| Parameter | Definition | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `utm_source` | **The "Who"** (The referrer) | `google`, `newsletter`, `facebook` |
| `utm_medium` | **The "How"** (Marketing channel) | `cpc` (paid), `email`, `social` |
| `utm_campaign` | **The "Why"** (Product/Promotion) | `spring_sale`, `webinar_launch` |
| `utm_content` | **The "What"** (Specific ad/link) | `sidebar_link`, `video_ad`, `text_link` |
| `utm_term` | **The Keywords** (Paid Search) | `running+shoes`, `marketing+course` |

::: {.notes}
- **Source:** The specific place the user was before they clicked.
- **Medium:** The broadest category of traffic.
- **Campaign:** The specific initiative.
- **Content:** Used for A/B testing (e.g., Red Button vs. Blue Button).
