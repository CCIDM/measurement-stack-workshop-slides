## Greetings and Introductions

::: {.callout-tip}
## Live slides available at <https://ccidm.github.io/measurement-stack-workshop-slides/ga4-gtm-gsc-workshop-slides.html>
:::

-   Jae Jung, Ph.D., Professor of Marketing, Director of CCIDM
-   Jarrod Griffin, Master's Student - M.S. Digital Marketing, Graduate Fellow, CCIDM



## Introduction & Orientation

- **The Objective:** Moving from marketing theory to Marketing Operations.
- **The Career Impact:** Employers need people who can prove their strategies work. By the end of this, you will have the technical skills to gather the data that validates your marketing decisions.
- **The Goal:** Gaining the ability to not just plan campaigns, but measure and optimize them.

::: {.notes}
"So, why are we here?

In your classes, you spend a lot of time on Marketing Theory—the 4 Ps, consumer behavior, segmentation. That is the 'Art' of marketing.

Today, we are moving into Marketing Operations. This is the 'Science.'

Employers aren't just looking for people who can come up with a great idea; they need people who can prove that idea actually worked. By the end of this session, you won't just be guessing if a campaign was successful—you will have the technical skills to gather the hard data that validates your decisions.

The goal is simple: We are moving you from 'Campaign Planner' to 'Performance Optimizer'."

:::


## Agenda

- Introduction & Orientation (5 min)
- **Conceptual Framework (10 Min):** The Data Ecosystem (GA4, GTM, GSC)
- **Technical Implementation (25 Min):** Setting up the environment
- **Search Visibility (15 Min):** Google Search Console integration
- **Campaign Tracking (15 Min):** Mastering UTM parameters
- **Performance Measurement (10 Min):** Defining and tracking Key Events


::: {.notes}
"Here is our roadmap for the next 90 minutes.

1.  **Conceptual Framework:** We’ll start with the big picture—how the 'Trinity' of Google tools talk to each other.
2.  **Technical Implementation:** This is the hands-on part. We will actually set up the environment.
3.  **Search Visibility:** We’ll look at Google Search Console to understand organic traffic.
4.  **Campaign Tracking:** We’ll master UTM parameters—the secret to tracking your specific links.
5.  **Performance Measurement:** Finally, we’ll define 'Key Events' so we can track what actually matters to the business."
:::

---

## Learning Outcomes:

After taking this workshop, participants should be able to:

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
1.	**Explain** how Google Analytics 4 (GA4), Google Tag Manager (GTM), and Google Search Console (GSC) work together to measure and improve digital marketing performance.
2.	**Configure Google Analytics 4 (GA4)** for a website using Google Tag Manager (GTM) to ensure reliable baseline tracking.
3.	**Validate and troubleshoot** GA4 event tracking using GTM Preview/Debug tools to confirm accurate event collection.
:::
::: {.column width="50%"}
4.	**Configure Google Search Console (GSC) and connect to GA4** to incorporate organic search query and landing-page performance data.
5.	**Build standardized UTM parameters** to track marketing campaigns consistently across channels and avoid attribution errors.
6.	**Set up and interpret GA4 Key Events**  to measure marketing outcomes.
:::

::::

::: {.notes}
"If you zone out, here is what you need to walk away with.

On the left, we have the **Setup**: You will be able to explain and configure GA4, GTM, and GSC. You’ll also learn how to debug them—because things *will* break, and you need to know how to fix them.

On the right, we have the **Strategy**: You’ll learn to connect GSC for SEO insights, build standardized UTMs so your data isn't messy, and set up Key Events to measure ROI.

If you can do these six things, you are already ahead of 90% of entry-level marketing applicants."

## Who Needs This Workshop?

Digital marketing roles fall into **4 categories**, and each needs this data stack differently.

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.fragment}
### 1. Content & Creative
*(Writers, Social, Designers)*

* **Focus:** The "What" (Assets & Copy).
* **Why:** You need **UTMs** to prove *which* specific creative drove a sale, moving you beyond "vanity metrics" (likes) to business value.

:::

::: {.fragment}
### 2. Technical & Performance
*(SEO, PPC, Email Specialists)*

* **Focus:** The "How" (Algorithms & Spend).
* **Why:** You live and die by ROI. You need **GSC** to monitor organic rank health and **GTM** to deploy ad tracking pixels instantly.

:::

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.fragment}
### 3. Data & Analytics
*(Analysts, Data Scientists)*

* **Focus:** Measurement & Prediction.
* **Why:** "Garbage In, Garbage Out." You need to understand the "plumbing" (**GTM**) to ensure the data feeding your models (SQL/Python/R) is accurate.

:::

::: {.fragment}
### 4. Strategy & Leadership
*(Managers, CMOs)*

* **Focus:** Planning & Budgeting.
* **Why:** You make high-stakes budget decisions. You must enforce **Standardization** (UTMs) so your team's reports are consistent and trustworthy.

::: {.notes}
"I often hear, 'I'm a creative, I don't need to know code.' That is incorrect. Digital marketing roles fall into four categories, and *all* of them rely on this stack.

1.  **Content & Creative:** If you write copy or design ads, you need **UTMs**. Otherwise, you’re just chasing 'vanity metrics' like likes. You need to know if your specific creative drove a sale.
2.  **Technical & Performance:** If you do SEO or PPC, you live and die by **GSC** and **GTM**. You need to deploy tracking pixels instantly without waiting for a developer.
3.  **Data & Analytics:** For the analysts, **GTM** is your plumbing. If the plumbing leaks, your Python or SQL models will be drinking dirty water. 'Garbage in, garbage out.'
4.  **Strategy & Leadership:** For the future managers, you hold the budget. You need to enforce **Standardization**. If your team isn't using UTMs correctly, you can't make good budget decisions."

## Trinity of Google Data Collection (10 Min)

::: {.columns .trinity}

::: {.column width="33.33%"}
#### Google Tag Manager

<div class="iconbox">
  ![](images/ic_tag_manager.svg){.icon}
</div>

#### 1. Collect (Tags & Triggers)

Use this to **control the data pipeline.** You configure **Tags** (what data to send) and **Triggers** (when to send it) without needing to edit the website code every time.
:::

::: {.column width="33.33%"}
#### Google Analytics 4

<div class="iconbox">
  ![](images/ic_analytics.svg){.icon}
</div>

#### 2. Analyze

Use this to **understand user behavior.** This is where you view reports, analyze traffic sources, and measure if your marketing campaigns are generating revenue.

:::

::: {.column width="33.33%"}
#### Google Search Console

<div class="iconbox">
  ![](images/logo_search_console.svg){.icon}
</div>

#### 3. Optimize

Use this to **monitor search health.** This provides technical feedback on site errors, indexing issues, and organic keyword performance that GA4 cannot see.
:::

:::


::: {.notes}
"Let's simplify the ecosystem. I call this the 'Trinity of Data Collection.'

First, **Google Tag Manager (GTM)**. Think of this as the **Brain**. It controls the data pipeline. You tell it *what* to send (Tags-like GA4, Meta Pixel) and *when* to send it (Triggers). It sits between your website and the rest of the world.

Second, **Google Analytics 4 (GA4)**. This is the **Database**. It stores the information and visualizes it. It tells you *what* users are doing on the site.

Third, **Google Search Console (GSC)**. This is the **Health Check**. It tells you how Google Search *sees* your site. It provides data that GA4 cannot see, like indexing errors and organic keyword rankings."
:::

---

## How they Connect

::: {.center}
![](images/trinity-diagram.png){width=85% fig-alt="Diagram showing data flow between GTM, GA4, and GSC."}
:::

- Install <span class="text-cpp-green">GTM</span> on the site (not GA4 code directly)
- <span class="text-cpp-green">GTM</span> sends events to <span class="text-cpp-gold">GA4</span>
- Link <span class="text-teal">GSC</span> to <span class="text-cpp-gold">GA4</span> for organic query + landing-page reporting

::: {.notes}
"Visually, it looks like this.

Notice the flow:
You do **not** install GA4 code directly on your website anymore. That is the old way.
Instead, you install **GTM (The Green Box)** on your site.
GTM then fires the data into **GA4 (The Gold Box)**.
Separately, we link **GSC (The Teal Box)** to GA4 so we can pull SEO data into our reports.

If you remember one thing from this slide: **GTM is the messenger; GA4 is the destination.**"

## Technical Implementation - GTM/GA4 (25 Min)

### **Goal**
Connect our **Quarto** site to the **Google Marketing Platform** (GA4 + GTM).

### **Assumptions**
To follow along, you need:

1.  **A Published Website:** Your site is live (e.g., Netlify, GitHub Pages).
2.  **Admin Access:** You have the ability to edit the source code or CMS settings.

::: {.fragment}

::: {.callout-note}

## Why this matters

We are moving from "static pages" to "measurable data" by injecting tracking codes into your live environment.

:::

:::

---

## Website Construction Options

There are two main paths for building the "container" for your data ecosystem.

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.fragment}
### 1. CMS
*(Content Management Systems)*

* **Pros:** Drag-and-drop, user-friendly.
* **Examples:**
    * Wix
    * WordPress
    * Squarespace
    * Weebly
    * Canva

:::
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.fragment}
### 2. Quarto Publication System
*(Technical & Academic)*

* **Pros:** Free hosting, version control (Git), reproducible.
* **Examples:**
    * Quarto Pub
    * GitHub Pages
    * Netlify

:::
:::

::::

::: {.fragment}
::: {.callout-important}
## For this workshop
We will use **RSMT’s website** (Rising Stars Muay Thai).
It is built in **Quarto** and is already connected/setup for us to analyze.

[https://www.risingstarsmuaythai.com](https://www.risingstarsmuaythai.com/?utm_source=ccidm_workshop&utm_medium=presentation_slides&utm_campaign=spring_2026_series)
:::
:::


::: {.notes}
"There are two ways websites are built today.

1.  **CMS (Content Management Systems):** Wix, WordPress, Squarespace. These are drag-and-drop. They are easy, but sometimes inflexible.
2.  **Publication Systems:** Like Quarto or GitHub Pages. These are preferred by technical marketers and academics because they are free, reproducible, and you have total control over the code.

For today, we are using the **Rising Stars Muay Thai** website. It’s a real-world site built in Quarto and linked to all these services, which gives us a perfect sandbox to demonstrate these concepts."
:::

## The GTM/GA4 Setup Flow

::: {.callout-tip}
## GA4: <https://analytics.google.com/> <br> GTM: <https://tagmanager.google.com/>
:::

Before we touch the code/website, we need the containers.

1.  **Create GTM Account:** Get your container ID (`GTM-XXXXXX`).
2.  **Install GTM Code:** Place the snippets on your website (`<head>` and `<body>`).
3.  **Create GA4 Property:** Get your Measurement ID (`G-XXXXXXXX`).
4.  **Connect in GTM:** Create a "Google Tag" inside GTM and paste your GA4 ID.
5.  **Publish:** Push the changes in GTM to make GA4 live.


::: {.notes}
"Here is the order of operations. It’s a 5-step process.

We don't just 'turn on' analytics. We have to build the containers first.
1.  **Create the GTM Account** and get the ID.
2.  **Install the GTM Code** on the website.
3.  **Create the GA4 Property** and get that ID.
4.  **Connect them:** Put the GA4 ID *inside* GTM.
5.  **Publish:** Push the 'Go' button.

Let's walk through creating the GTM container first."
:::

---


## Create GTM Container

:::: {.columns}


::: {.column width="50%"}
### Why GTM?
* **The Box Metaphor:** GTM is the empty box; GA4 is just one tool you put inside it.
* **Efficiency:** You install the GTM code **once**. Future changes (Facebook Pixel, LinkedIn Insight, GA4 Events) happen inside GTM, not your site code.

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### The Setup
1.  **Log in:** [tagmanager.google.com](https://tagmanager.google.com).
2.  **Create Account:** Enter Company Name.
3.  **Create Container:** Enter Domain (e.g., `mysite.com`).
4.  **Select Platform:** Choose **Web**.
5.  **Install:** Get the `<head>` and `<body>` scripts.
:::



::::

::: {.notes}
"Why do we start with GTM?

Think of GTM as an empty box. GA4 is just one tool you put inside that box. Later, if you want to add a Facebook Pixel or LinkedIn Insight Tag, you put them in the box too.

If you didn't use GTM, you’d have to edit your website's source code every single time you wanted to add a marketing tool. With GTM, you install the code **once**, and then manage everything else from the Google dashboard.

Log in to Tag Manager, create an account, select 'Web', and it will give you two snippets of code—one for the Head, one for the Body."
:::

---


## Create GA4 Property

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
#### The Setup
1. Go to **Analytics** > **Admin**.
2. Click **Create Account**.
3. Follow the wizard to create your **Property**.
4. **Save:** Copy the **Measurement ID** (`G-XXXXXXXX`) for your website code.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
#### Best Practices
* **One Property Rule:** Most businesses only need **1 Property**.
* **Cross-Device:** Combine your Website and App data in the *same* property for better user tracking.
* **When to split?** Only use multiple properties for different **Regions** (Timezones/Currencies) or **Marketing Teams**.

:::

::::

::: {.notes}
"Now, let's go to Google Analytics and create the property.

Go to Admin > Create Property.
A common question I get is: 'Do I need a separate property for my mobile app and my website?'
**No.** In GA4, we combine them. We want to track the *user*, not the device. If they visit on mobile and then on desktop, we want that data in one place.

Once you save, copy the **Measurement ID**—it starts with `G-`. That is your destination address."
:::

---

## The "Big 3" Sections of GA4

We will focus on the **Overview** reports to get a high-level health check of the business.

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="33%"}
### 1. Acquisition
*(Reports > Generate Leads > Overview)*

* **The Question:** "Where is traffic coming from?"
* **Key Card:** **New Users by Channel**.
* **Look For:**
    * **Organic Search:** (SEO working?)
    * **Email/Manual Source:** (Are the newsletters driving sessions?)
    * **Google Ads:** (Paid campaign performance).

:::

::: {.column width="33%"}
### 2. Engagement
*(Reports > Understand web and/or app traffic > Overview)*

* **The Question:** "Is the site interesting?"
* **Key Metric:** **Average Engagement Time**.
* **Look For:**
    * **Time:** (e.g., *1m 35s*). If this is low (<10s), users are leaving immediately.
    * **Top Pages:** Which specific pages get the most views?

:::

::: {.column width="33%"}
### 3. Explore
*(The Custom Report Builder)*

* **The Question:** "Why did they drop off?"
* **The limitation:** The Overview reports tell you *what* happened, but not *why*.
* **The Solution:** We use **Explore** to build custom funnels when the standard dashboards aren't enough.

:::

::::

::: {.notes}
"While we are in GA4, let's orient ourselves. There are three main reports you’ll use daily:

1.  **Acquisition:** This answers 'Where did they come from?' Look at the *New Users by Channel* card. Is your SEO working? Are your ads driving traffic?
2.  **Engagement:** This answers 'Is the site interesting?' Look at *Engagement Time*. If it’s under 10 seconds, you have a problem—people are landing and leaving.
3.  **Explore:** This is for the data scientists. The standard reports tell you *what* happened; the Explore tab lets you build custom funnels to figure out *why* it happened."
:::


---

## Connect GA4 to GTM

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
### The Connection
1.  **New Tag:** Select **Google Tag**.
2.  **ID:** Paste `G-XXXXXXXX`.
3.  **Trigger:** Choose **Initialization - All Pages**.
4.  **Save:** Name it "GA4 Config".
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### The Launch
1.  **Submit:** Click the blue button in the top right.
2.  **Version:** Give it a name (e.g., "Initial GA4 Launch").
3.  **Publish:** This pushes your changes to the live website.
:::

::::

> **Note:** Until you hit **Publish**, your changes are only saved in a "Draft" version.

::: {.notes}
"Now, the handshake. We have GTM and we have GA4. Let's introduce them.

Inside **GTM**, create a new tag. Select 'Google Tag'.
Paste that `G-` Measurement ID we just copied.
For the Trigger, select **Initialization - All Pages**. This ensures analytics loads immediately when a user visits.

**Crucial Step:** You must hit **Submit** and **Publish**. In GTM, nothing is live until you Publish. If you just click 'Save', it sits in a draft folder and does nothing."
:::


---


## Validation

1.  **Open DebugView:**
    - Go to **GA4 Admin** > **Data Display** > **DebugView**.
2.  **Trigger Data:**
    - Open your website in a new tab (or use GTM Preview Mode).
    - Click around to generate events.
3.  **Verify:**
    - Look for the blue icons appearing on the timeline.
    - Confirm the `page_view` event is listed.

::: {.callout-important}
## Expected Outcome
If you see events populating the timeline in real-time, your connection is successful. If the timeline is empty, check if your ad blocker is on!
:::

::: {.notes}
"Trust, but verify.

How do we know it worked?
Go to GA4, specifically the **DebugView** under Admin.
Open your website in a new tab and click around.
If you see blue icons popping up on the timeline in real-time, congratulations—you are tracking data.

If the timeline is empty, check your browser extensions. Ad Blockers will kill your ability to debug your own work."
:::

---


## Search Visibility: Google Search Console (15 Min)

<https://search.google.com/search-console/>

### **Goal**
1.  **Verify** ownership of your website with Google.
2.  **Connect** GSC data to your GA4 dashboard.

::: {.callout-note}
## Why do this?
* **GA4** tells you *what* users do on your site (clicks, scrolls).
* **GSC** tells you *how* users found you (keywords, rankings).
* **Together:** You see the full picture of your SEO performance.

:::

::: {.notes}
"We’ve handled the user behavior (GA4). Now let's handle the search engine (GSC).

Google Search Console is the only place where Google tells you exactly how often your site appeared in search results and which keywords you rank for.

Our goal here is to verify ownership and link it to GA4 so we can see that keyword data inside our analytics reports."
:::

---

## Step 1: Add Property (Choose Type)

When you click "Add Property" in GSC, you have two choices:

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
### 1. Domain Property (Recommended)
* **Covers:** `example.com`, `m.example.com`, `www.example.com`, `http://`, `https://`.
* **Requires:** DNS Verification (Harder).
* **Best For:** Long-term business tracking.

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### 2. URL Prefix
* **Covers:** ONLY the exact URL entered (e.g., `https://www.example.com`).
* **Requires:** File upload, HTML tag, or GA4 (Easier).
* **Best For:** Quick setup or if you lack DNS access.

:::

::::

::: {.notes}
"When you add a site to GSC, you face a fork in the road: **Domain** vs **URL Prefix**.

**Domain Property** is the 'Gold Standard'. It tracks *everything* attached to your name—http, https, www, mobile. But, it requires DNS verification, which means logging into GoDaddy or Namecheap.

**URL Prefix** is the 'Lite Version'. It only tracks the specific URL you type in. However, it is much easier to verify.

For a serious business, use Domain. For a quick project, URL Prefix is fine."
:::

---

## Step 2: Verify Ownership

Google needs proof you own the site. Choose the method that fits your access level:

| Method | Difficulty | Best Use Case |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **DNS Record** | High | **Domain Property.** Best for full coverage. Requires logging into GoDaddy/Namecheap. |
| **HTML File** | Medium | **URL Prefix.** You have FTP/File access to the server root. |
| **HTML Tag** | Low | **URL Prefix.** WordPress/Wix users. Copy/paste a meta tag into your header. |
| **GA4 / GTM** | **Lowest** | **URL Prefix.** If you *already* installed GA4/GTM (and have "Edit" permission), this verifies instantly! |

::: {.notes}
"Google won't show you data unless you prove you own the site.

If you chose **Domain Property**, you must use the DNS record method.
If you chose **URL Prefix**, you have easier options.

:::


---

## Step 3: Link GSC to GA4

Data doesn't appear automatically. You must **Link** and **Publish**.

1.  **Link:**
    * Go to **GA4 Admin** > **Product Links** > **Search Console Links**.
    * Click **Link**, select your GSC property, and confirm.
2.  **Publish Reports:**
    * Go to **Reports** > **Library** (bottom left folder icon).
    * Find the **"Search Console"** collection card.
    * Click the **3 dots** > **Publish**.

> **Result:** A new "Search Console" tab will appear in your main reporting menu, showing Queries and Landing Pages.

::: {.notes}
"Now, let's pull that search data into GA4.

Go to GA4 Admin > Product Links > Search Console Links.
Select your property and confirm.

**One extra step people always forget:** By default, the reports are hidden. You have to go to the **Library** in the Reports section and 'Publish' the Search Console collection. Once you do that, a new tab appears on your dashboard showing you Organic Queries and Landing Pages."
:::

---

## Campaign Tracking: UTM Parameters (15 Min)

### **The Blind Spot**
Without UTMs, GA4 can usually tell you **where** a user came from (e.g., "They came from Facebook").

**But it cannot tell you:**

* **How** they got there (Paid Ad vs. Free Post?)
* **Why** they came (Spring Sale vs. Black Friday?)

::: {.callout-note}
## The Solution
UTM parameters are "tags" we add to the end of a link. They force GA4 to record exactly what we tell it to record. Example in GA4 > Reports > User acquisition > First user source / medium
:::

::: {.notes}
"We are shifting gears now to **Campaign Tracking**.

GA4 is smart, but it’s not psychic. It knows a user came from 'Facebook', but it doesn't know *how* or *why*. Did they click a paid ad? A free post? Was it the Spring Sale or the Winter Clearance?

This is the 'Blind Spot'. To fix it, we use **UTMs**. These are little tags we add to the end of a URL that force GA4 to record exactly what we want it to."
:::

---

## Standard UTM Parameters

| Parameter | Definition | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `utm_source` | **The "Who"** (The referrer) | `google`, `newsletter`, `facebook` |
| `utm_medium` | **The "How"** (Marketing channel) | `cpc` (paid), `email`, `social` |
| `utm_campaign` | **The "Why"** (Product/Promotion) | `spring_sale`, `webinar_launch` |
| `utm_content` | **The "What"** (Specific ad/link) | `sidebar_link`, `video_ad`, `text_link` |
| `utm_term` | **The Keywords** (Paid Search) | `running+shoes`, `marketing+course` |

::: {.notes}
"There are 5 standard parameters. You should know the top three by heart:

1.  **Source:** The 'Who'. Where is the user right now? (e.g., Google, Newsletter, Facebook).
2.  **Medium:** The 'How'. How did they get here? (e.g., CPC, Email, Social).
3.  **Campaign:** The 'Why'. What initiative is this? (e.g., Spring_Sale).

If you are consistent with these, your reporting becomes crystal clear. You can tell exactly which email blast generated the most revenue."
:::

---



## Standardization Protocols

Data is only useful if it is consistent.

### **Rule 1: Case Sensitivity**
GA4 treats `Email`, `email`, and `EMAIL` as three completely different traffic sources.

* **Best Practice:** Always use **lowercase** for everything.

### **Rule 2: Fragmentation**
If five people on your team name campaigns differently, your reports will be unreadable.

* *Bad:* `spring-sale`, `Spring_Sale`, `springsale26`
* *Good:* `spring_sale_2026` (Standardized)

::: {.notes}
"Warning: UTMs are fragile.

**Rule 1:** They are case-sensitive. 'Email', 'email', and 'EMAIL' will show up as three separate rows in your report. **Always use lowercase.**

**Rule 2:** Standardization. If I name a campaign `spring-sale` and my colleague names it `Spring_Sale`, our data is fragmented. As managers, you must enforce a naming convention (like snake_case) across the team."
:::

---

## Interactive Exercise

**Goal:** Create a tracking link for a **LinkedIn post** promoting the **Spring Workshop**.

1.  **Open Tool:** [Google Campaign URL Builder](https://ga-dev-tools.google/campaign-url-builder/)
2.  **Enter Values:**

| Parameter | Value | Logic |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Website URL** | `https://yoursite.com` | Where they go. |
| **Campaign Source** | `linkedin` | The specific site. |
| **Campaign Medium** | `social` | The marketing channel. |
| **Campaign Name** | `spring_workshop_2026` | The strategic effort. |

3.  **Result:** Copy the generated URL and test it.

::: {.notes}
"Let's try it. I want everyone to open the **Google Campaign URL Builder**.

Imagine we are posting a link on LinkedIn for a 'Spring Workshop'.
We enter:
* **Source:** linkedin
* **Medium:** social
* **Campaign:** spring_workshop_2026

The tool generates a long URL. When someone clicks that long link, GA4 captures those three pieces of data perfectly. This is how you prove ROI."
:::

## Performance Measurement: Key Events (10 Min)

### **The 2025 Terminology Shift**
Google has renamed metrics to align better with Google Ads.

| Old Term | **New Term** | Definition |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Event | **Event** | Something happened (Page view, scroll). |
| Conversion | **Key Event** | Something *important* happened (Purchase, Signup). |
| *N/A* | **Conversion** | A Key Event shared with Google Ads for bidding. |

## The Rule
In GA4, you measure **Key Events**.
In Google Ads, you bid on **Conversions**.
:::

::: {.notes}
"Finally, let's talk about success.

In 2025, Google changed their terminology.
We used to call important actions 'Conversions'. Now, in GA4, they are called **Key Events**.

An **Event** is anything that happens (a scroll, a click).
A **Key Event** is something important that happens (a purchase, a signup).
The term **Conversion** is now reserved strictly for Google Ads bidding.

We need to tell GA4 which events are 'Key'."

## Step 1: Create the Trigger (The "When")

In Google Tag Manager:

1.  **Go to Triggers** > **New**.
2.  **Trigger Type:** Select **Page View**.
3.  **Fire On:** Select **Some Page Views**.
4.  **Condition:**
    * `Page Path` contains `/thank-you`
    * *(Or `/confirmed`, `/success` - whatever your URL is).*

> **Logic:** We only want this to fire when a user actually lands on the confirmation page.

::: {.notes}
"Let's say we want to track a 'Lead'. Usually, when someone fills out a form, they are redirected to a 'Thank You' page.

In **GTM**, we create a Trigger.
We tell GTM: 'Fire this trigger ONLY when the **Page Path** contains `/thank-you`'.

This is the logic: If the user sees the Thank You page, they must have filled out the form."
:::

## Step 2: Create the Tag (The "What")

In Google Tag Manager:

1.  **Go to Tags** > **New**.
2.  **Tag Type:** **Google Analytics: GA4 Event**.
3.  **Configuration:**
    * **Measurement ID:** Paste your `G-XXXXXXXX`.
    * **Event Name:** `generate_lead`
    * *(Note: Use standard snake_case names).*
4.  **Triggering:** Select the **"Thank You Page"** trigger you just made.

::: {.callout-tip}
## Why `generate_lead`?
Using Google's [Recommended Event Names](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/ga4/reference/events) unlocks automatic reporting features in the dashboard.
:::

::: {.notes}
"Now we attach that Trigger to a Tag.

Create a new **GA4 Event Tag**.
Name the event `generate_lead`.
**Note:** Use the standard Google names (like `generate_lead`, `purchase`, `sign_up`). If you use these standard names, GA4 automatically builds better reports for you.

Attach the 'Thank You Page' trigger and **Publish**."
:::

---

## Step 4: The Handshake (GA4)

Even if GTM sends the event, GA4 treats it as "just another event" until you tell it otherwise.

**The "Immediate Fix" Method:**

1.  **Go to:** Admin > Data Display > **Events**.
2.  **Click:** **New Key Event**.
3.  **Name:** Enter `generate_lead` exactly as you typed it in GTM.
4.  **Save.**

> **Why do this manually?**
> Automatic detection can take 24 hours. Creating it manually ensures it is tracked as a Key Event **immediately** from the moment you publish.

::: {.notes}
"Last step. GTM is sending the event `generate_lead` to GA4.
But right now, GA4 just thinks it's a normal event, like a page scroll.

To promote it to a **Key Event**:
Go to GA4 Admin > Events.
Create a New Key Event and type in `generate_lead` exactly as you set it up in GTM.

Now, every time someone hits that Thank You page, your 'Key Events' counter goes up by one. That is your measure of success."

## Thank You & What's Next?

### **The Spring 2026 Analytics Series**

You have completed **Workshop 1: Collection**. Here is the roadmap for the rest of the semester:

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Next Up: Workshop 2**
**"The Data Warehouse"**
*(BigQuery + SQL + Looker)*

* **The Problem:** GA4 deletes user data after 14 months and applies "sampling" (guessing) to large reports.
* **The Solution:** We will connect GA4 to **BigQuery** to own our raw data forever and use SQL for deep analysis.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Future Sessions**

* **Workshop 3: Scale Analysis**
    * *(R + DuckDB)*: How to process millions of rows on a laptop without crashing it.
* **Workshop 4: Production Reporting**
    * *(Quarto + Automation)*: Auto-scheduling reports for stakeholders.
:::

::::

::: {.notes}
"We have just finished **Workshop 1: Measurement & Collection**. You now have a live data pipeline.

But this is just the foundation. As you grow, GA4 has limits. It samples data when traffic gets high, and it deletes user-level history after 14 months.

In **Workshop 2**, we will solve this by building a **Data Warehouse**. We will connect GA4 to **BigQuery** so you can own your raw data forever and use SQL to ask questions the standard reports can't answer.

Later in the semester, **Workshop 3** will teach you how to analyze that 'big-ish' data using high-performance R tools, and **Workshop 4** will show you how to automate the whole thing into production-grade reports.

Thank you for your time, and I look forward to seeing you at the next session!"
