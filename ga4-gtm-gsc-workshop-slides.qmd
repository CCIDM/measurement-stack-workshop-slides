## How they Connect

::: {.center}
![](images/trinity-diagram.png){width=85% fig-alt="Diagram showing data flow between GTM, GA4, and GSC."}
:::

- Install <span class="text-cpp-green">GTM</span> on the site (not GA4 code directly)
- <span class="text-cpp-green">GTM</span> sends events to <span class="text-cpp-gold">GA4</span>
- Link <span class="text-teal">GSC</span> to <span class="text-cpp-gold">GA4</span> for organic query + landing-page reporting

::: {.notes}
- Trinity of Data Collection:
  a. GTM (Google Tag Manager): The Brain, Controls what data is sent and when.  
  b. GA4 (Google Analytics 4): The Database, Stores and reports the data.  
  c. GSC (Google Search Console): The Search Health Check: Monitors organic search visibility.
- Instructional design angle: students should be able to name the role of each tool in one sentence.

## Quick access links

- <span class="text-cpp-gold">GA4</span>: <https://analytics.google.com/>
- <span class="text-cpp-green">GTM</span>: <https://tagmanager.google.com/>
- <span class="text-teal">GSC</span>: <https://search.google.com/search-console/>



::: {.callout-tip}
Use one **Google account** across tools.
:::

---

## Technical Implementation - GTM/GA4 (25 Min)

### **Goal**
Connect our **Quarto** site to the **Google Marketing Platform** (GA4 + GTM).

### **Assumptions**
To follow along, you need:

1.  **A Published Website:** Your site is live (e.g., Netlify, GitHub Pages).
2.  **Admin Access:** You have the ability to edit the source code or CMS settings.

::: {.callout-note}
## Why this matters
We are moving from "static pages" to "measurable data" by injecting tracking codes into your live environment.
:::

---

## The Account Setup

::: {.callout-tip}
## GA4: <https://analytics.google.com/> <br> GTM: <https://tagmanager.google.com/>
:::

Before we touch the code/website, we need the containers.

1.  **Create GTM Account:** Get your container ID (`GTM-XXXXXX`).
2.  **Install GTM Code:** Place the snippets on your website (`<head>` and `<body>`).
3.  **Create GA4 Property:** Get your Measurement ID (`G-XXXXXXXX`).
4.  **Connect in GTM:** Create a "Google Tag" inside GTM and paste your GA4 ID.
5.  **Publish:** Push the changes in GTM to make GA4 live.

## Create GTM Container

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
### The Setup
1.  **Log in:** [tagmanager.google.com](https://tagmanager.google.com).
2.  **Create Account:** Enter Company Name.
3.  **Create Container:** Enter Domain (e.g., `mysite.com`).
4.  **Select Platform:** Choose **Web**.
5.  **Install:** Get the `<head>` and `<body>` scripts.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Why GTM?
* **The Box Metaphor:** GTM is the empty box; GA4 is just one tool you put inside it.
* **Efficiency:** You install the GTM code **once**. Future changes (Facebook Pixel, LinkedIn Insight, GA4 Events) happen inside GTM, not your site code.
:::

::::

## Create GA4 Property

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
#### The Setup
1. Go to **Analytics** > **Admin**.
2. Click **Create Account**.
3. Follow the wizard to create your **Property**.
4. **Save:** Copy the **Measurement ID** (`G-XXXXXXXX`) for your website code.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
#### Best Practices
* **One Property Rule:** Most businesses only need **1 Property**.
* **Cross-Device:** Combine your Website and App data in the *same* property for better user tracking.
* **When to split?** Only use multiple properties for different **Regions** (Timezones/Currencies) or **Marketing Teams**.
:::

## Connect GA4 to GTM

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
### The Connection
1.  **New Tag:** Select **Google Tag**.
2.  **ID:** Paste `G-XXXXXXXX`.
3.  **Trigger:** Choose **Initialization - All Pages**.
4.  **Save:** Name it "GA4 Config".
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### The Launch
1.  **Submit:** Click the blue button in the top right.
2.  **Version:** Give it a name (e.g., "Initial GA4 Launch").
3.  **Publish:** This pushes your changes to the live website.
:::

::::

> **Note:** Until you hit **Publish**, your changes are only saved in a "Draft" version.




---


## Validation

1.  **Open DebugView:**
    - Go to **GA4 Admin** > **Data Display** > **DebugView**.
2.  **Trigger Data:**
    - Open your website in a new tab (or use GTM Preview Mode).
    - Click around to generate events.
3.  **Verify:**
    - Look for the blue icons appearing on the timeline.
    - Confirm the `page_view` event is listed.

::: {.callout-important}
## Expected Outcome
If you see events populating the timeline in real-time, your connection is successful. If the timeline is empty, check if your ad blocker is on!

## Search Visibility with <span class="text-teal">GSC</span>

- Configure Google Search Console on the website
- Connect <span class="text-teal">GSC</span> to <span class="text-cpp-gold">GA4</span>
- In GA4: Reports → Library → **Publish** “Search Console”

::: {.notes}
Source content:
12) Configuration
a. Configure Google Search Console on website (different methods) and then connect GSC to GA4.
b. Go to GA4 > Reports > Library. Find the "Search Console" collection and click Publish. (Without this, the reports remain invisible).
c. Discussion: Why configure GSC and link to GA4?

Facilitation:
- Ask: “What questions can GA4 not answer about search without GSC?”
  Examples: query terms, impressions, average position.
:::

---

## GSC configuration methods

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="48%"}
### Domain Property
- Verify via **DNS settings** at domain provider
:::

::: {.column width="52%"}
### URL Prefix Property
- HTML file upload (developer access)
- HTML tag (WordPress/CMS users)
- GA4/GTM (best if GA4 or GTM already exists)
:::

::::

::: {.notes}
Source content:
13) GSC Configuration Methods:
a. Domain Property: DNS settings in domain provider.
b. URL Prefix Property:
  i. HTML file upload – developer access.
  ii. Html tag – wordpress/CMS users (easiest).
  iii. GA4/GTM – best for sites that already have GA4 or GTM.

Teaching point:
- The “best” method is the one students can actually execute with their access level.
:::

---

## Campaign Tracking with <span class="text-citrus">UTMs</span>

- UTMs add **campaign intent** to traffic attribution
- Standardization prevents reporting from fragmenting

<div class="placeholder-box">Visual placeholder: Google Campaign URL Builder screenshot</div>

::: {.notes}
Source content:
14) Strategic Rationale:
a. Why do we need them? “Without UTMs, GA4 can usually tell you where a user came from (e.g., 'They came from Facebook'). But it cannot tell you how they got there or why (e.g., 'Did they click the expensive ad we paid for, or just a free post on our wall?')”

Use the quote verbally; keep the slide short.
:::

---

## Standardization protocols

- Be consistent across teams and channels
- <span class="text-citrus">UTM</span> is case sensitive  
  `Facebook != facebook`
- Decide naming rules **before** campaigns launch

::: {.notes}
Source content:
15) Standardization Protocols:
a. Need to be standardized or else data becomes fragmented.
b. Utm is case sensitive, Facebook!=facebook.

Facilitation:
- Give students a simple convention: lowercase, underscores, no spaces.
:::

---

## Interactive exercise: build a UTM

Scenario: “Create a link for a LinkedIn post promoting the Spring Workshop.”

```text
utm_source=linkedin
utm_medium=social
utm_campaign=spring_workshop_2026
```

::: {.notes}
Source content:
16) Interactive Exercise:
a. Use the Google Campaign URL Builder.
b. Scenario: "Create a link for a LinkedIn post promoting the Spring Workshop."
c. Table:
i. utm_source: linkedin
ii. utm_medium: social
iii. utm_campaign: spring_workshop_2026
d. Standard Parameters Table (Cover at URL Builder)

Coaching:
- Ask students to paste their full generated URL in chat for quick scanning.
:::

---

## Key Events: measuring outcomes

- <span class="text-cpp-gold">GA4 Event</span>: something happened (page visit, scrolling)
- <span class="text-rose">GA4 Key Event</span>: something important happened (purchase, signup, etc.)
- “Conversion” = a Key Event you share with Google Ads for bidding

::: {.notes}
Source content:
17) Terminology Shift (2025 Update):
a. GA4 Event: something happened (page visit, scrolling).
b. GA4 Key Events (formerly called “Conversions”).
  i. Key event: something important happened (purchase, form signup, view resume, etc).
c. Conversion: a Key Event that we explicitly shared with Google Ads for bidding.

Teaching move:
- Make sure students don’t overuse Key Events; keep them aligned to business outcomes.
:::

---

## Key Event implementation (via GTM)

### Step 1: Create the Trigger (GTM)

```text
Trigger: Thank You Page
Type: Page View
Fire On: Some Page Views
Condition: Page Path contains "thank-you" (or "contact")
```

::: {.notes}
Source content:
18) Implementation Strategy (via GTM):
a. Step 1: Create the Trigger in GTM
  i. Type: Page View.
  ii. Fire On: Some Page Views → Page Path contains "thank-you" (or "contact").

Coaching:
- If their site uses a different path, have them identify it in the browser URL bar first.
:::

---

## Key Event implementation (via GTM)

### Step 2: Create the Tag (GTM)

```text
Tag: Google Analytics: GA4 Event
Measurement ID: (use the variable from the Google Tag)
Event Name: generate_lead
Trigger: Thank You Page
```

::: {.notes}
Source content:
18b) Step 2: Create the Tag in GTM
i. Create a new Tag: Google Analytics: GA4 Event.
ii. Measurement ID: Use the variable created in Section III (or paste ID).
iii. Event Name: generate_lead (Standardized naming is crucial).
iv. Trigger: Select the "Thank You Page" trigger created in Step 1.

Teaching point:
- Naming consistency is what makes analysis scalable across sites and time.
:::

---

## Publish & test

- Publish the <span class="text-cpp-green">GTM</span> container
- Visit the Thank You page
- Confirm in <span class="text-cpp-gold">GA4</span> DebugView that <span class="badge badge-citrus">generate_lead</span> fired

::: {.notes}
Source content:
18c) Step 3: Publish & Test:
i. Publish the GTM container.
ii. Visit the "Thank You" page on the site.
iii. Check GA4 DebugView to see the generate_lead event fire.

Quick troubleshooting:
- If tag fires in GTM Preview but not in GA4 DebugView, check Measurement ID and whether the Google Tag is published.
:::

---

## The handshake in GA4

- GA4 Admin → Data Display → **Events**
- It may take **24 hours** for new events to appear automatically
- Immediate fix: **Create Key Event** manually  
  Name: `generate_lead` (exact match)

::: {.notes}
Source content:
18d) Step 4: The Handshake (In GA4):
i. Go to GA4 Admin > Data Display > Events.
ii. Note: It may take 24 hours for the new event to appear in the list automatically.
iii. Immediate Fix: Click "Create Key Event" manually.
iv. Name: Enter generate_lead exactly as typed in GTM.
v. Save: Now, every time GTM fires this tag, GA4 will count it as a Key Event.

Instructional design:
- Ask students: “Where could this break?” and list: trigger rule, tag config, publish, DebugView verification, key event creation.
:::

---

## Wrap-up

- You now have:
  - Baseline <span class="text-cpp-green">GTM</span> → <span class="text-cpp-gold">GA4</span> tracking
  - A validation workflow (Preview/Debug + DebugView)
  - <span class="text-teal">GSC</span> linkage path for search reporting
  - Standardized <span class="text-citrus">UTMs</span> and a <span class="text-rose">Key Event</span> pattern

::: {.notes}
- Close by revisiting Learning Outcomes and checking them off.
- Point them to next steps: add additional events (scroll depth, outbound clicks), build an exploration in GA4, and document naming conventions.
