## Learning Outcomes:

After taking this workshop, participants should be able to:

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
1.	**Explain** how Google Analytics 4 (GA4), Google Tag Manager (GTM), and Google Search Console (GSC) work together to measure and improve digital marketing performance.
2.	**Configure Google Analytics 4 (GA4)** for a website using Google Tag Manager (GTM) to ensure reliable baseline tracking.
3.	**Validate and troubleshoot** GA4 event tracking using GTM Preview/Debug tools to confirm accurate event collection.
:::
::: {.column width="50%"}
4.	**Configure Google Search Console (GSC) and connect to GA4** to incorporate organic search query and landing-page performance data.
5.	**Build standardized UTM parameters** to track marketing campaigns consistently across channels and avoid attribution errors.
6.	**Set up and interpret GA4 Key Events**  to measure marketing outcomes.
:::

::::

::: {.notes}
- Read these quickly so students can self-check expectations.
- Tell them you’ll return to these as a “definition of done” at the end.
:::

---

## Before the workshop

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Required**

- Create Google Account and Accept Invite to <span class="text-cpp-green">GTM</span>/<span class="text-cpp-gold">GA4</span>.
:::
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Optional (used for deployment)**

- Download/Setup <span class="text-citrus">RStudio</span>
- Download/Setup <span class="text-teal">Git</span>
- Access Starter Website Repo (Not yet created)
:::

::::

::: {.notes}
- The optional items are only needed if they want to publish/deploy the Quarto site during/after the workshop.
- If they are only learning the workflow conceptually, they can still follow along without deploying.
:::

---

## Introduction & Orientation

## Trinity of Data Collection

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
  subgraph Site[Website / Quarto site]
    U[Users + content interactions]
  end

  GTM[[GTM<br/>The Brain]]
  GA4[(GA4<br/>The Database)]
  GSC[[GSC<br/>Search Health Check]]

  U -->|page_view + events| GTM
  GTM -->|sends events| GA4
  GSC -. monitors .-> Site
  GSC -->|queries • clicks • impressions| GA4
```

::: {.notes}
- Trinity of Data Collection:
  a. GTM (Google Tag Manager): The Brain, Controls what data is sent and when.  
  b. GA4 (Google Analytics 4): The Database, Stores and reports the data.  
  c. GSC (Google Search Console): The Search Health Check: Monitors organic search visibility.
- Instructional design angle: students should be able to name the role of each tool in one sentence.
:::

---

## How they connect

- Install <span class="text-cpp-green">GTM</span> on the site (not GA4 code directly)
- <span class="text-cpp-green">GTM</span> sends events to <span class="text-cpp-gold">GA4</span>
- Link <span class="text-teal">GSC</span> to <span class="text-cpp-gold">GA4</span> for organic query + landing-page reporting

::: {.notes}
Source content:
5) How They Connect: Explain that we do not put GA4 code on the site; we put GTM code on the site, and GTM sends data to GA4
6) Provide Links to Google services, talk about invites.

Practical reminders:
- GA4 “Measurement ID” lives in GA4 Admin → Data Streams.
- GTM “Container ID” is separate and is what’s embedded on the site.
:::

---

## Quick access links

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="55%"}
- <span class="text-cpp-gold">GA4</span>: <https://analytics.google.com/>
- <span class="text-cpp-green">GTM</span>: <https://tagmanager.google.com/>
- <span class="text-teal">GSC</span>: <https://search.google.com/search-console/>

**Today’s rule:** use one Google account across tools.
:::
::: {.column width="45%"}
<div class="placeholder-box">Visual placeholder: QR codes / short links</div>
:::

::::

::: {.notes}
- Prompt students to accept invites before you start the build steps.
- If they’re locked out, that becomes a hard blocker later (especially for GTM publish).
:::

---

## Technical Implementation (overview)

- Step 1: The Setup
. . .
- Step 2: The Quarto Integration
. . .
- Step 3: The GA4 Configuration Tag
. . .
- Step 4: Publishing
. . .
- Step 5: Validation

::: {.notes}
- Use this slide to keep attention on sequence.
- Then slow down and execute each step with check-ins.
:::

---

## Step 1 — The Setup

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="55%"}
- Create <span class="text-cpp-gold">GA4</span> property
- Create a <span class="text-cpp-green">GTM</span> account + container
- Confirm you have:
  - Admin access
  - GA4 Measurement ID (<span class="text-cpp-gold">G-XXXXXXXX</span>)
  
:::
::: {.column width="45%"}
<div class="placeholder-box">Visual placeholder: GA4 property + Data Stream screen</div>

:::

::::

::: {.notes}
Source content:
7) Step 1: The Setup:
a. Greate GA4 Property
b. Create a Google Tag Manager Account and Container

Teaching move:
- If students are in groups, assign one person to be “navigator” and one to be “builder” to reduce click-errors.
:::

---

## Step 2 — Quarto Integration

**Action:** copy the <span class="text-cpp-green">GTM</span> snippets

- `<script>` goes in **Head**
- `<noscript>` goes in **Body**

### include-in-header.html

```{=text}

<!-- Google Tag Manager -->
<script>(function(w,d,s,l,i){w[l]=w[l]||[];w[l].push({'gtm.start':
new Date().getTime(),event:'gtm.js'});var f=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],
j=d.createElement(s),dl=l!='dataLayer'?'&l='+l:'';j.async=true;j.src=
'https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtm.js?id='+i+dl;f.parentNode.insertBefore(j,f);
})(window,document,'script','dataLayer','GTM-ABC12345');</script>
<!-- End Google Tag Manager -->
```

### include-before-body.html

```{=text}
include-before-body.html
<!-- Google Tag Manager (noscript) -->
<noscript><iframe src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/ns.html?id=GTM-ABC12345"
height="0" width="0" style="display:none;visibility:hidden"></iframe></noscript>
<!-- End Google Tag Manager (noscript) -->
```

::: {.notes}
Source content:
8) Step 2: The Quarto Integration:
a. Action: Copy the GTM <script> (Head) and <noscript> (Body) snippets.
b. Implementation: Paste snippets into include-in-header.html and include-before-body.html, then reference these in the _quarto.yml file.

Tip:

- Emphasize “Head vs Body” placement because that’s the most common mistake.
:::

---

## Step 2 — Wire it up in `_quarto.yml`

```yaml
# _quarto.yml (site/project root)
project:
  type: website

format:
  html:
    include-in-header: include-in-header.html
    include-before-body: include-before-body.html
```

- Re-render locally **or** publish to Netlify/GitHub Pages

::: {.notes}
Source content:
8c) Render: Re-render the Quarto site locally or publish to Netlify/GitHub Pages.

Coaching:
- If they deploy: remind them GTM publish and website publish are separate actions.
:::

---

## Step 3 — GA4 Configuration Tag (in GTM)

- Create a **Google Tag** (formerly Config Tag)
- Measurement ID: <span class="text-cpp-gold">G-XXXXXXXX</span>
- Trigger: **All Pages**

```text
GTM Tag Configuration
---------------------
Tag Type: Google Tag
Measurement ID: G-XXXXXXXX
Trigger: All Pages
```

::: {.notes}
Source content:
9) Step 3: The GA4 Configuration Tag:
a. In GTM, create a "Google Tag" (formerly Config Tag).
b. Paste the GA4 Measurement ID (G-XXXXXXXX). ((Find this in GA4 Admin > Data Collection > Data Streams > Click the Arrow))
c. Trigger: All Pages.

Emphasize:
- This is baseline tracking. We’re verifying page_view first before adding custom events.
:::

---

## Step 4 — Publishing (do this now)

- In <span class="text-cpp-green">GTM</span>, click <span class="highlight">SUBMIT</span>
- Then click <span class="highlight">PUBLISH</span>

::: {.notes}
Source content:
10) Step 4: Publishing:
a. Critical Step: Students must hit SUBMIT and PUBLISH in GTM now.

Common failure mode:
- Students create tags but never publish, then wonder why GA4 is empty.
:::

---

## Step 5 — Validation

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="55%"}
- Open **GA4 DebugView**
- Open the site in a new tab
- Look for <span class="badge badge-green">page_view</span> appearing in the timeline
:::
::: {.column width="45%"}
<div class="placeholder-box placeholder-tall">Visual placeholder: DebugView timeline showing <strong>page_view</strong></div>
:::

::::

::: {.notes}
Source content:
11) Step 5: Validation:
a. Use GA4 DebugView (Admin > Data Display > DebugView).
b. Open the site in a new tab. Look for the "page_view" event appearing in the timeline
c. Expected Outcome: We will see events firing off in GA4.

Also mention:
- GTM Preview/Debug: use it when you need to confirm “did the tag fire?”
- DebugView confirms “did GA4 receive it?”
:::

---

## Search Visibility with <span class="text-teal">GSC</span>

- Configure Google Search Console on the website
- Connect <span class="text-teal">GSC</span> to <span class="text-cpp-gold">GA4</span>
- In GA4: Reports → Library → **Publish** “Search Console”

::: {.notes}
Source content:
12) Configuration
a. Configure Google Search Console on website (different methods) and then connect GSC to GA4.
b. Go to GA4 > Reports > Library. Find the "Search Console" collection and click Publish. (Without this, the reports remain invisible).
c. Discussion: Why configure GSC and link to GA4?

Facilitation:
- Ask: “What questions can GA4 not answer about search without GSC?”
  Examples: query terms, impressions, average position.
:::

---

## GSC configuration methods

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="48%"}
### Domain Property
- Verify via **DNS settings** at domain provider
:::

::: {.column width="52%"}
### URL Prefix Property
- HTML file upload (developer access)
- HTML tag (WordPress/CMS users)
- GA4/GTM (best if GA4 or GTM already exists)
:::

::::

::: {.notes}
Source content:
13) GSC Configuration Methods:
a. Domain Property: DNS settings in domain provider.
b. URL Prefix Property:
  i. HTML file upload – developer access.
  ii. Html tag – wordpress/CMS users (easiest).
  iii. GA4/GTM – best for sites that already have GA4 or GTM.

Teaching point:
- The “best” method is the one students can actually execute with their access level.
:::

---

## Campaign Tracking with <span class="text-citrus">UTMs</span>

- UTMs add **campaign intent** to traffic attribution
- Standardization prevents reporting from fragmenting

<div class="placeholder-box">Visual placeholder: Google Campaign URL Builder screenshot</div>

::: {.notes}
Source content:
14) Strategic Rationale:
a. Why do we need them? “Without UTMs, GA4 can usually tell you where a user came from (e.g., 'They came from Facebook'). But it cannot tell you how they got there or why (e.g., 'Did they click the expensive ad we paid for, or just a free post on our wall?')”

Use the quote verbally; keep the slide short.
:::

---

## Standardization protocols

- Be consistent across teams and channels
- <span class="text-citrus">UTM</span> is case sensitive  
  `Facebook != facebook`
- Decide naming rules **before** campaigns launch

::: {.notes}
Source content:
15) Standardization Protocols:
a. Need to be standardized or else data becomes fragmented.
b. Utm is case sensitive, Facebook!=facebook.

Facilitation:
- Give students a simple convention: lowercase, underscores, no spaces.
:::

---

## Interactive exercise: build a UTM

Scenario: “Create a link for a LinkedIn post promoting the Spring Workshop.”

```text
utm_source=linkedin
utm_medium=social
utm_campaign=spring_workshop_2026
```

::: {.notes}
Source content:
16) Interactive Exercise:
a. Use the Google Campaign URL Builder.
b. Scenario: "Create a link for a LinkedIn post promoting the Spring Workshop."
c. Table:
i. utm_source: linkedin
ii. utm_medium: social
iii. utm_campaign: spring_workshop_2026
d. Standard Parameters Table (Cover at URL Builder)

Coaching:
- Ask students to paste their full generated URL in chat for quick scanning.
:::

---

## Key Events: measuring outcomes

- <span class="text-cpp-gold">GA4 Event</span>: something happened (page visit, scrolling)
- <span class="text-rose">GA4 Key Event</span>: something important happened (purchase, signup, etc.)
- “Conversion” = a Key Event you share with Google Ads for bidding

::: {.notes}
Source content:
17) Terminology Shift (2025 Update):
a. GA4 Event: something happened (page visit, scrolling).
b. GA4 Key Events (formerly called “Conversions”).
  i. Key event: something important happened (purchase, form signup, view resume, etc).
c. Conversion: a Key Event that we explicitly shared with Google Ads for bidding.

Teaching move:
- Make sure students don’t overuse Key Events; keep them aligned to business outcomes.
:::

---

## Key Event implementation (via GTM)

### Step 1: Create the Trigger (GTM)

```text
Trigger: Thank You Page
Type: Page View
Fire On: Some Page Views
Condition: Page Path contains "thank-you" (or "contact")
```

::: {.notes}
Source content:
18) Implementation Strategy (via GTM):
a. Step 1: Create the Trigger in GTM
  i. Type: Page View.
  ii. Fire On: Some Page Views → Page Path contains "thank-you" (or "contact").

Coaching:
- If their site uses a different path, have them identify it in the browser URL bar first.
:::

---

## Key Event implementation (via GTM)

### Step 2: Create the Tag (GTM)

```text
Tag: Google Analytics: GA4 Event
Measurement ID: (use the variable from the Google Tag)
Event Name: generate_lead
Trigger: Thank You Page
```

::: {.notes}
Source content:
18b) Step 2: Create the Tag in GTM
i. Create a new Tag: Google Analytics: GA4 Event.
ii. Measurement ID: Use the variable created in Section III (or paste ID).
iii. Event Name: generate_lead (Standardized naming is crucial).
iv. Trigger: Select the "Thank You Page" trigger created in Step 1.

Teaching point:
- Naming consistency is what makes analysis scalable across sites and time.
:::

---

## Publish & test

- Publish the <span class="text-cpp-green">GTM</span> container
- Visit the Thank You page
- Confirm in <span class="text-cpp-gold">GA4</span> DebugView that <span class="badge badge-citrus">generate_lead</span> fired

::: {.notes}
Source content:
18c) Step 3: Publish & Test:
i. Publish the GTM container.
ii. Visit the "Thank You" page on the site.
iii. Check GA4 DebugView to see the generate_lead event fire.

Quick troubleshooting:
- If tag fires in GTM Preview but not in GA4 DebugView, check Measurement ID and whether the Google Tag is published.
:::

---

## The handshake in GA4

- GA4 Admin → Data Display → **Events**
- It may take **24 hours** for new events to appear automatically
- Immediate fix: **Create Key Event** manually  
  Name: `generate_lead` (exact match)

::: {.notes}
Source content:
18d) Step 4: The Handshake (In GA4):
i. Go to GA4 Admin > Data Display > Events.
ii. Note: It may take 24 hours for the new event to appear in the list automatically.
iii. Immediate Fix: Click "Create Key Event" manually.
iv. Name: Enter generate_lead exactly as typed in GTM.
v. Save: Now, every time GTM fires this tag, GA4 will count it as a Key Event.

Instructional design:
- Ask students: “Where could this break?” and list: trigger rule, tag config, publish, DebugView verification, key event creation.
:::

---

## Wrap-up

- You now have:
  - Baseline <span class="text-cpp-green">GTM</span> → <span class="text-cpp-gold">GA4</span> tracking
  - A validation workflow (Preview/Debug + DebugView)
  - <span class="text-teal">GSC</span> linkage path for search reporting
  - Standardized <span class="text-citrus">UTMs</span> and a <span class="text-rose">Key Event</span> pattern

::: {.notes}
- Close by revisiting Learning Outcomes and checking them off.
- Point them to next steps: add additional events (scroll depth, outbound clicks), build an exploration in GA4, and document naming conventions.
